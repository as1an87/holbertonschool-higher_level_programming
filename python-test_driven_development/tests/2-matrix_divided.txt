# Test 1: Regular matrix with integer division
matrix= [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] / div= 3
# Expected output: [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

# Test 2: Regular matrix with string as divisor
matrix= [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] / div= "3"
# Expected output: TypeError div must be a number

# Test 3: Regular matrix with divisor as 0
matrix= [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] / div= 0
# Expected output: ZeroDivisionError division by zero

# Test 4: Not a list of lists of integers
matrix= [1, 2, 3] / div= 3
# Expected output: TypeError matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

# Test 5: Matrix with rows of different sizes
matrix= [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]] / div= 3
# Expected output: TypeError Each row of the matrix must have the same size

# Test 6: Regular matrix with divisor as float('inf')
matrix= [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] / div= float('inf')
# Expected output: [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]]

# Test 7: Matrix with one element as float('inf')
matrix= [[1, 2, 3], [4, float('inf'), 6]] / div= 3
# Expected output: ValueError matrix contains invalid element (inf or nan)

# Test 8: Matrix with one element as float('nan')
matrix= [[1, 2, 3], [4, float('nan'), 6]] / div= 3
# Expected output: ValueError matrix contains invalid element (inf or nan)

# Test 9: Missing one argument
matrix= [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
# Expected output: TypeError missing required positional argument: 'div'

# Test 10: Missing both arguments
# Expected output: TypeError missing required positional argument: 'matrix' and 'div'
